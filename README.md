# perm-bracket-map
Maps permutations of length n to the set of brackets L(n) that follow certain properties.

Definition of L(k) below taken from paper "The operad Lie is free" by Paolo Salvatore and Robert Tauraso.

Let L(k) be the set of formal expressions obtained by applying iterated binary brackets to k symbols, such that:
(1) Each symbol appears exactly once;
(2) The smallest index inside a bracket appears on the left-hand side, and the largest index appears on the right-hand side.
