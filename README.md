# Bijective map from permutations to bracket expressions
The module *perm_bracket_map* includes functions to map between permutations of length *n* and bracket expressions *L(n+1)*.

## Bracket expressions
The following definition of bracket expressions *L(n)* is taken from ["The operad Lie is free"](https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3010) by Paolo Salvatore and Robert Tauraso.

Let *L(n)* be the set of formal expressions obtained by applying iterated binary brackets to *k* symbols, such that:
1. Each symbol appears exactly once;
2. The smallest index inside a bracket appears on the left-hand side, and the largest index appears on the right-hand side.

The bijection between permutations and bracket expressions is proved in an upcoming paper "Bracket-connected permutations".
